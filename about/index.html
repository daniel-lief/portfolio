      I'm currently a second-year student at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, based in the Bay Area. I love UX/product design and frontend development, and I believe in using empathy to create the best technology for humans.<br><br>
      I discovered UX design and frontend deelopment in high school when I did hackathons with my friends. I realized how much I enjoyed turning ideas into technology I can see, and products I can feel as I use them.<br><br>
      Right now I'm interning as a UX Designer & Engineer at REScan, a spatial computing company developing a mobile app. <br><br>
      I really value simple and smooth design that can make the user's life better. Every time I design I want to step into the user's shoes and understand what their experience is like, so that I can ideate on how to improve it.<br><br>
      When I'm not designing and developing, you can find me playing chess, taking photos, and solving puzzles.
